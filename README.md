# Sanctions Checker

## Description

Sanctions Checker allows users to check whether the individuals, companies or entities that they are working with are sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council or other countries.

The Sanctions Checker serves as a convenient search function that returns results of sanctioned individuals, companies, and politically exposed persons and their associates and counterparts, for businesses to be alerted to the sensitive nature of their counterparts before commencing business or concluding transactions

### Technical Usage

```
- React framework

### Unsolved problems

List of unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.

```

- Due to the varied sources of sanctions data, a person's name may appear multiple times in the search results due to different permutations (first name, last name). While it is good to see the various sanctions on the same person (from different countries), future permutation of the app will consolidate search results for the same person and avoid repetition.
