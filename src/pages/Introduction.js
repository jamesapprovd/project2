      <h3>What are sanctions?</h3>
      <p>
        The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions regimes aim to
        prevent or settle conflicts, curtail nuclear proliferation, counter
        terrorism and human-rights violations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals or organisations engaging in illegal activities can end up
        on these sanctions lists or watchlists. Such activities can include:
      </p>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering">
          <li>money laundering</li>
        </a>
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/combating-financing-terrorism-cft.asp">
          <li>terrorism and terrorist financing</li>

          <li>violation of international treaties</li>
        </a>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Organizations, banks, and financial institutions have to comply with
        sanction obligations. Failure to comply can lead to significant legal,
        financial and reputational ramifications.
      </p>
      <h3>What is sanctions screening?</h3>
      <p>
        Sanctions screening involves screening individuals, groups or companies
        against designated sanction lists according to the countries in which an
        organisation does business. This can take the form of manually inputting
        a name into an online search tool such as this one, or automatically
        screening customer and stakeholder databases regularly.
